I am particularly motivated by advancing eco-metabolomics as a novel lens for understanding ecosystem resilience, linking biochemical pathways with community dynamics and ecosystem processes. My expertise spans field ecology and controlled experiments, trait-based and phylogenetic approaches, and eco-metabolomics workflows, including data acquisition, annotation, and ecological informatics. I also have strong skills in statistical modelling, trait scaling, and ecosystem modelling, which I use to bridge organismal strategies with ecosystem-level outcomes. With experience in alpine ecosystems, trait evolution, and species identification, I bring a multi-scale perspective that integrates molecular, community, and ecosystem dimensions. This interdisciplinary background positions me to develop innovative frameworks for predicting ecosystem responses to recurrent drought and other global change drivers."
